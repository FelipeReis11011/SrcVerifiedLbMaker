# SrcVerifiedLeaderboardMaker

A script to find the top 200 sr.c moderators with more runs verified, it checks all games in the site in search for moderators and gets only the ones with more than 1650 runs verified.

usage:

- run the Modfinder.py to get a top 200 list in the csv

- run the modLB.py to update the runs verified value and sort them

it doesnt work for moderators with more than 20 thousand verified runs
